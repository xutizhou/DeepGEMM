# SM90 MXFP4 MegaMoE — optimization record

Target: the fused MXFP4 MegaMoE kernel on this branch
(`deep_gemm/include/deep_gemm/impls/sm90_mxfp4_mega_moe_h200_fused*.{cuh,inl}`),
measured against the two NVFP4 reference branches:

* `origin/megamoe_nvfp4_dev_m` — the fused H200 NVFP4 kernel this branch was
  ported from. Its files are **byte-identical** to the `nvfp4` arm carried on
  this branch, so it can be benchmarked *in the same process* as MXFP4, on the
  same weights and the same routing. That is the strongest comparison available
  and it is what every `nvfp4` column below is.
* `origin/megamoe_nvfp4_dev` — the "all-M" branch, an auto-selecting portfolio
  (`kernel_family="auto"`) whose small-M arms are register-source
  specializations of the same kernel. It has no SM90 FP8 MegaMoE and no MXFP4,
  so it can only be compared across processes; see the A/B/B/A protocol below.

Nothing here changes the numerics: weight format, scale semantics, activation
dtype, output dtype, shapes and tile boundaries are untouched. Every change is
either a different way of computing the same bits, a different schedule, or a
bug fix.

## 1. Measurement contract

| | |
|---|---|
| Shape | MiMo-V2.5-Pro MoE: hidden 6144, intermediate 2048, 384 experts, top-k 8, EP8 (48 experts/rank) — the only shape all three implementations accept |
| Hardware | 8x H20-3e (`viking-prod-583`) and 8x H200 (`viking-prod-321`), computelab |
| Harness | `tests/bench_mega_moe_formats_sm90.py` — all arms built from the **same** BF16 weights and the **same** routing inside one process, interleaved and repeated |
| Timing | `bench_kineto` CUDA kernel time, median over `--reps` repetitions of 20 timed calls, 8 GB L2 flush between calls |
| M | source tokens **per rank**, before top-k expansion |

Two properties of this harness matter for reading any number below:

* **Within one process, arms are directly comparable.** They see identical
  weights, identical routing and the same drift.
* **Across processes they are not.** Re-running the identical configuration
  moves the median by up to ~5 % on these nodes, and a fresh process also draws
  a different router (the `recv=` column). Every claim in this document is
  therefore either a within-process delta, or an A/B/B/A alternation.

## 2. Where the branch started

`origin/megamoe_mxfp4_dev_m` as shipped, versus its own in-process NVFP4 arm
(= `megamoe_nvfp4_dev_m`), 8x H200:

| M | mxfp4 (us) | nvfp4 dev_m (us) | mxfp4 vs dev_m |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 16 | 515.3 | 405.9 | +26.9 % |
| 32 | 596.0 | 415.6 | +43.4 % |
| 64 | 953.4 | 466.7 | +104.3 % |
| 128 | 820.3 | 553.9 | +48.1 % |
| 256 | 633.2 | 510.9 | +23.9 % |

The MXFP4 port is a *minimal* delta from NVFP4 — the kernel bodies differ only
in the dequant call sites and the removal of NVFP4's shared LUT — so the whole
gap had to be in the dequant.

---

## 3. Root cause, at SASS level

`make_scaled_lut()` folded the E8M0 exponent into the magnitude table with
byte-wise saturating SIMD intrinsics (`__vaddus4`, `__vsubus4`, `__vminu4`,
`__vcmpgeu4`). **Hopper has no native byte-wise SIMD**, so ptxas emulates all of
them. Isolated probes (`nvcc -cubin` + `cuobjdump -sass`, `sm_90a`):

| probe | non-NOP SASS |
|---|---:|
| MXFP4 `make_scaled_lut` alone | **78** (39 LOP3 + 8 PRMT + 3 VIADD + …) |
| NVFP4 shared-LUT load **plus** full word decode | 34 |
| MXFP4 word decode with the table already in registers | 18 |

It ran once per 32-element scale group — four times per BK128 weight row per
thread. Over a whole row:

| full BK128 row decode | non-NOP SASS |
|---|---:|
| register-folded scale (as shipped) | **420** |
| shared-memory table (this branch now) | **179** |

So the format that should have been *cheaper* to dequantize than NVFP4 — one
scale per 32 elements instead of per 16 — was paying 2.4x more.

---

## 4. What the public / in-repo implementations do

| source | technique | verdict here |
|---|---|---|
| `megamoe_nvfp4_dev` (in repo) | **register-source (RS) WGMMA A operand** for the swapAB tiles: dequantize straight into the MMA's A registers, no decoded-B tile in shared memory | **adopted** — see §5.3 |
| `megamoe_nvfp4_dev` | `--ptxas-options=--register-usage-level=5` on its RS arms | **rejected**: no effect on either kernel here (168 regs / 0 spill / identical QGMMA+DEPBAR counts either way). The 168 comes from the kernel's own `warpgroup_reg_alloc<208>`, not from ptxas's heuristic |
| `megamoe_nvfp4_dev` | per-(target, model, M-range) bucket tables | adopted in spirit, not in form: the tier boundaries here are computed from the shape and the SM count (§5.4) rather than enumerated |
| Marlin-style nibble packing (already in this repo) | pre-permute nibbles so the PRMT selector is the packed word masked with `0x77777777` | already present; it is why the decode is 6 ops/word |
| `YijiaZhao/hopper_megamoe_basedondeepgemm` (public, same DeepGEMM lineage) | decode **unscaled** — every E2M1 magnitude is exactly representable in E4M3, so the table is two compile-time constants — and apply the E8M0 coefficient during accumulator promotion, which is exact because the WGMMA's K (32) equals MXFP4's group | not adopted: it needs one WGMMA group and one promotion per 32-K slice, which multiplies accumulator traffic; the table lookup here is already down to ~4 instructions per group. Recorded because it is the natural next step if the promotion cost ever becomes free |
| same | scaled-LUT-by-arithmetic over a restricted exponent window (`exponent * 0x08080808 + base`), with a x256 bias so no saturation logic is needed | not adopted, same reason — 2 IMAD vs 1 clamp + 1 LDS is not where the time is anymore |
| same | 2 K128 blocks per pipeline stage at the BM8 tier | not tried; noted as the remaining idea for the smallest tiles |
| LiquidGEMM (SC'25) | defer dequantization to the epilogue | not applicable: MXFP4's scale varies along K inside the reduction, so it cannot be hoisted past the K-sum |
| vLLM PR #53709 | on Hopper, **re-encode MXFP4 experts to block-FP8 at load time** (lossless: E2M1 x 2^k is exactly representable in E4M3 once the block scale absorbs the exponent) and run the existing block-FP8 MoE — no dequant in the kernel at all, at 2x the weight bytes | deliberately not taken: the `fp8` column in §9 is exactly that trade on this shape, and the FP4 path is 8-19 % ahead of it on H200. It is the right answer only if the kernel is dequant-bound *and* HBM is free, which is the regime this work removed |
| sglang PR #38884 | SM90 mixed-input CUTLASS grouped GEMM feeding MXFP4 nibbles to WGMMA directly, activations in BF16 | different operating point (W4A16, prefill); this kernel is W4A8 and already runs FP8 tensor cores |
| FlashInfer | NVFP4/MXFP4 (de)quantization kernels and scale-layout helpers | mostly Blackwell-targeted (native block-scaled FP4 MMA); nothing SM90-specific to port |

---

## 5. Changes made

### 5.1 32-entry shared-memory scaled-LUT window

`make_scaled_lut()` stays as the definition of the numerics, but the mainloop
reads its output from a table built once per CTA. Sweeping all 256 E8M0 codes
shows only **20 distinct tables**, at codes 118..137 (k = -9..+10): below that
every magnitude underflows E4M3's normal range and flushes to zero, above it
every magnitude saturates at 448. A **32-entry clamped window (256 B)**
therefore reproduces `make_scaled_lut` bit-exactly for every code — a quarter of
the 1 KB table the NVFP4 path loads, and half as many lookups per row, because
MXFP4 groups 32 elements where NVFP4 groups 16.

Verified bit-exact by a standalone gate: all 256 codes agree, and all
256 x 65536 packed-word patterns decode identically. The same check is now part
of `tests/test_mxfp4_mega_moe_sm90_correctness.py`, which passes 14/14 over
M = 1..256 x two global-scale modes plus 3/3 over M = 257/512/1024, every case at
cosine 0.9988-0.9990 — the same values the branch reported before this work.

### 5.2 Decoded-B ring sized correctly, pre-barrier region padded to the combine floor

The decoded-B tile was allocated `kNumStages` deep. Decode and consume are
serialized inside one K-block iteration (`warpgroup_wait<0>` before the loop
closes) and the two warpgroups touch disjoint N halves of the same BN256 tile,
so **one slot is enough** — the ring was holding `(kNumStages-1) x 32 KB` of
tiles nobody could read, and that is what capped the pipeline at 3-4 stages.

Freeing it exposed a second constraint: the combine phase reuses the whole
pre-GEMM region as its own ring and needs at least
`3 x warps x hidden x 2 / chunks` bytes of it. That floor is now explicit, so
the GEMM region is padded up to it instead of tripping a static assert.

### 5.3 Register-source (RS) WGMMA A operand

Ported from `megamoe_nvfp4_dev`. Lane pairs own one weight row of the half tile;
each K32 slice is two packed words plus one `__shfl_xor_sync` to assemble both
lanes' four A registers. Nothing lands in shared memory, so `kNumDecodedBStages`
drops to **0** and the pipeline-depth ceiling rises from 3-4 (original) to 7 (SS)
to **8-10** (RS).

MXFP4 needs **one** table lookup per K32 slice where NVFP4 needs two, because
its scale group is exactly the WGMMA's K.

Within the RS path, half 1's decode is issued under half 0's in-flight MMA. This
is deliberately *intra*-stage: prefetching the next K-block instead was measured
and is worse (§6).

### 5.4 Schedule selection

* Pipeline depth per tier comes from the sweep, and shared memory is always
  requested at full capacity. The old per-tier `smem_size` constants were the
  exact layout size of one fixed stage count; once depth became tunable they
  became a trap that faults with an illegal address rather than failing to
  compile. **This was a real bug** and is what the M=64 / M=128 crashes during
  tuning turned out to be.
* The swapAB tile is selected while a local expert's tokens still fit one tile —
  `num_tokens * num_ranks * num_topk / num_experts <= BLOCK_M` — scaled by SM
  count, because a transposed tile issues a WGMMA of N<=24 where the straight
  tile issues one of 128 and therefore needs ~5x the MMA instructions for the
  same work. Measured: BM24 wins by 6.5 % at M=128 and loses by 57 % at M=256 on
  H20's 78 SMs; on H200's 132 it already loses by 23 % at M=128 and wins by
  4.6 % at M=64. The formula reproduces both crossovers and moves with the shape
  instead of being pinned to a model name.
* RS is disabled for the BM8 tiers on parts wider than the reference SM count,
  where the tier is short enough that the shuffle latency is not hidden.
* An over-tight host assertion (`swap_ab == (num_tokens <= 64)`) was replaced by
  the constraint the kernel actually has (`swap_ab => BLOCK_M <= 24`), which is
  what had made the larger-batch swapAB experiments unreachable.

### 5.5 Contiguous weight tiles

The fused weight tensor was `(E, N, k_blocks * 80)`: N-major, so the
`BLOCK_N` rows a pipeline stage wants sat `k_blocks * 80` bytes apart and the
stage load was `BLOCK_N` strided 80-byte TMA requests. Section 7.2 measures what
that costs — 63 % of the device's streaming bandwidth.

`mxfp4_fused_to_tile_contiguous` regroups the same rows into
`(E, n_tiles * k_blocks, 128 * 80)`, one contiguous block per
`(expert, 128-row n-tile, k-block)`, and the loader issues `BLOCK_N / 128`
`cp.async.bulk` copies instead of a 2D TMA. Properties that made this cheap:

* It is a **pure byte permutation** done offline in the weight transform, so
  every quantized value, scale byte and sign-braid position is untouched. The
  correctness sweep returns the same cosine to four decimals.
* The tile row count is a constant 128 rather than `BLOCK_N`, so the offline
  layout stays valid for every `BLOCK_N` the selector can pick.
* A bulk copy has no descriptor, so the two weight `CUtensorMap`s and their
  prefetches go away; the kernel takes two base pointers instead.

Once the tile is bulk-copied, the 12 B of padding in each 80 B row has no
reason to exist either — it was there only because a TMA descriptor needs a
row that is a multiple of 16. Dropping it naively gives a 68-byte row, which
misaligns the 128-bit loads the Mode2 decoders use, and a 64-byte row plus a
separate scale plane is 16 words, which 4-way bank-conflicts them. Storing the
tile **16-byte-chunk-major** avoids both: chunk `c` of row `r` at
`c * 128 * 16 + r * 16`, then the E8M0 bytes at `128 * 64 + r * 4`. Every chunk
stays 16-byte aligned, the bank pattern is arithmetically identical to the
80-byte row (`4r mod 32` instead of `20r mod 32`, both 8 distinct banks over a
phase), and the row costs its natural 68 bytes. `decode_tile_row` is the one
place that knows the layout; all three decoders go through it.

`EVICT_NORMAL` is passed explicitly rather than taking `tma_load_1d`'s streaming
default, because above the swapAB tiers one expert spans several m-blocks and
those CTAs share these tiles through L2.

### 5.6 The transposed tile is a token tile, so pick it by tokens per expert

Under swapAB the tile's `BLOCK_M` *is* the WGMMA's token dimension, so a tile
wider than one local expert's token count pads the MMA with slots that carry
nothing. Routing puts `num_tokens * num_ranks * num_topk / num_experts` slots on
an expert, and the selector already had `max_tokens_for_block_m` to invert that.
Taking the narrowest tile that still covers it replaces three hand-set `BLOCK_M`
tiers with one rule, and reproduces every measured optimum:

| M | slots/expert | rule | measured (EP1, 48 experts) |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 32 | 5.3 | BM8 | BM8 **330.5** vs BM16 337.3 vs BM24 343.2 |
| 64 | 10.7 | BM16 | BM16 **355.2** vs BM24 361.4 |
| 128 | 21.3 | past the swapAB bound | BM64 **419.0** vs BM24 443.0 vs BM16 640.8 |

One step too narrow is much worse than one too wide, because the expert no
longer fits one m-block and its weights are re-read: BM16 at M=128 costs 45 %,
BM8 at M=64 costs 47 %. The rule never does that -- it only ever rounds up.

With the rule in the selector, the default arm lands on the measured optimum
(same process, EP1/48 experts):

| part | M | default | BM8 | BM16 | BM24 | default before |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| H200, 132 SM | 32 | **330.8** | 330.9 | 335.8 | 343.2 | 337.6 |
| H200, 132 SM | 64 | **355.3** | 522.9 | 355.7 | 361.4 | 361.1 |
| H20-3e, 78 SM | 32 | **503.3** | 503.3 | 536.2 | 542.9 | — |
| H20-3e, 78 SM | 64 | 581.9 | 813.1 | 581.4 | **572.5** | — |

One exception, and it is left in deliberately. At M=64 on 78 SMs, BM24 is 1.6 %
faster than the BM16 the rule picks, where on 132 SMs BM16 is 1.7 % faster than
BM24. That is the same SM-count dependence the swapAB bound above already
encodes — a wider tile amortises per-tile overhead where the part is issue-bound,
a narrower one wastes less WGMMA width where it is load-bound. Scaling the rule
for it would mean fitting a factor to one 1.6 % data point, so the rule stays as
measured: it wins 6.1 % at M=32 on 78 SMs and 2.0 % on 132, and gives up 1.6 % at
one point on one part.

The RS gate needed rescoping with it. It had disabled the register-source
operand for `BLOCK_M < 16` on parts wider than the reference SM count, which the
new rule would have applied at M=32; measured there, the same BM8 tile is 4.3 %
*faster* with RS (330.5) than without (345.5). The gate is a statement about how
little work a tier has, not about `BLOCK_M`, so it is now scoped to the batches
it was measured on.

### 5.7 Test and harness fixes found on the way

* `tests/compile_all_megamoe_kernels.sh` could not instantiate the MXFP4 kernel
  at all — its argument list predated the `kNumSMs` and shape template
  parameters, so the gate had been silently reporting a compile failure as the
  status quo. Fixed, and extended to cover the four tiers that actually ship.
* `tests/bench_mega_moe_formats_sm90.py` grew in-process schedule-variant arms
  (`--mxfp4-scheds BM,STAGES,EPW[,SINGLE_DISPATCH[,RS]]`). Comparing schedules
  across processes is meaningless here — a fresh process draws a different
  router — and this is what made the tuning numbers trustworthy.
* `srun` inherits stdin and swallowed the rest of any script fed to it over
  `bash -s`, which silently truncated batch runs after the first configuration.

---

## 6. Numerics

The correctness gate's reference uses the **same** FP8 input activations the
kernel gets (`x_ref` is `x_fp8 * x_sf` in fp32) and the **exact** MXFP4
dequantized weights, in fp32 throughout. So the residual it reports is purely
the kernel's own arithmetic.

Measured on the real weight distribution (randn x 0.05, 4 x 2048 x 6144):

| path | exactly representable in E4M3 | mean rel err |
|---|---:|---:|
| **MXFP4 weight -> E4M3** | **100.0000 %** | **0** |
| NVFP4 weight -> E4M3 | 74.23 % | 1.59e-2 |
| W4A8 intermediate, per-128 E4M3 round trip | — | 2.24e-2 |

E2M1's eight magnitudes are all exactly representable in E4M3 and E8M0 is a pure
exponent shift, so **MXFP4's dequant-to-FP8 path is lossless for the weights** —
the FP8 WGMMA sees exactly the MXFP4 values, saturation/flush at the range ends
being the only exception and one the shipped `make_scaled_lut` already defines.
NVFP4 on the same path must round, because UE4M3 carries a mantissa.

The 0.9989 / 0.9990 cosine the gate reports is therefore the **W4A8 intermediate
requantization** (L1 output is stored as FP8 e4m3 with per-128 scales before L2),
which is a property of the format contract and identical for the fp8, nvfp4 and
mxfp4 arms. It is unchanged before and after this work, at every M.

The LUT window itself is bit-exact against the function it replaces: all 256
E8M0 codes and all 256 x 65536 packed-word patterns agree.

---

## 7. What the kernel is bound by

Per rank per call: `FLOPs = 2 * routes * 3*H*I`, weight bytes =
`touched_experts * 3*H*I * 80/128`, plus `routes * (3H + 2I)` of activations and
`routes * (H/32 + I/8)` of activation scales. Peaks: H200 1979 TF/s dense FP8 and
4.8 TB/s; H20-3e 296 TF/s and 4.8 TB/s.

| dev | M | AI (F/B) | ridge | bound | achieved TF/s | roofline | % of roofline | % of FP8 peak | % of HBM peak |
|---|---:|---:|---:|:--:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| H200 | 8 | 5.3 | 412 | mem | 12.5 | 25.3 | 49.5 % | 0.6 % | 49.5 % |
| H200 | 32 | 18.6 | 412 | mem | 50.0 | 89.4 | **55.9 %** | 2.5 % | 55.9 % |
| H200 | 64 | 32.7 | 412 | mem | 82.9 | 156.8 | 52.8 % | 4.2 % | 52.8 % |
| H200 | 128 | 67.3 | 412 | mem | 163.9 | 322.9 | 50.8 % | 8.3 % | 50.8 % |
| H200 | 256 | 134.0 | 412 | mem | 309.6 | 643.4 | 48.1 % | 15.6 % | 48.1 % |
| H200 | 2048 | 829 | 412 | cmp | 522.9 | 1979 | 26.4 % | 26.4 % | 13.1 % |
| H20-3e | 32 | 17.1 | 61.7 | mem | 32.3 | 82.1 | 39.4 % | 10.9 % | 39.4 % |
| H20-3e | 64 | 36.5 | 61.7 | mem | 68.1 | 175.3 | 38.8 % | 23.0 % | 38.8 % |
| H20-3e | 128 | 67.5 | 61.7 | **cmp** | 95.7 | 296.0 | 32.3 % | 32.3 % | 29.5 % |
| H20-3e | 256 | 132.5 | 61.7 | **cmp** | 161.1 | 296.0 | **54.4 %** | 54.4 % | 25.3 % |
| H20-3e | 2048 | 832 | 61.7 | cmp | 187.1 | 296.0 | 63.2 % | 63.2 % | 7.6 % |

Three regimes, and they are qualitatively different:

1. **Decode (M <= 256) is weight-stream and fixed-overhead bound, not compute
   bound.** AI is 3-134 F/B against H200's ridge of 412, so the tensor cores see
   0.2-15.6 % of peak. A linear fit gives **H200: 401 us + 52 ns/token** and
   **H20-3e: 550 us + 203 ns/token** — even at M=256, 78 % (H200) and 57 % (H20)
   of the time does not depend on how many tokens there are. The 48-expert weight
   stream alone is **236 us at HBM peak**, and the kernel runs that stream at
   **48-56 % of peak** on H200. The remaining ~165 us of the H200 intercept is
   dispatch/combine/NVLink barriers, launch, and dequant that is not hidden.
2. **H20-3e crosses to compute-bound near M ~ 120** (its ridge is only 61.7 F/B
   because its FP8 rate is 6.7x lower at the same bandwidth) and reaches **54 %
   of dense FP8 peak at M=256**.
3. **Prefill (M >= 1024) is compute-bound on both, and there FP4 is the wrong
   trade.** Hopper has no FP4 MMA: the format buys HBM bytes, which stop
   mattering once compute-bound, and pays ALU for the dequant. Measured at
   M=2048: MXFP4 reaches 26.4 % of FP8 peak on H200 where the FP8 MegaMoE reaches
   33.7 %, and 63.2 % vs 77.6 % on H20-3e — a 20-25 % deficit that is the dequant
   tax, not a scheduling problem.

### 7.1 Splitting the runtime three ways

`kNumRanks` became a template parameter, so the same kernel runs at EP1 — one
rank, no all-to-all, no cross-rank barriers. Running EP1 with 48 experts against
EP8 with 384 gives each GPU the same weight volume and the same routed-token
count, so the difference is exactly what the collective costs. H200, MXFP4:

| M | EP1 / 48 experts | EP8 / 384 experts | collective |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 287.8 us (34 exp) | 368.3 us (37 exp) | +80.5 |
| 32 | 385.1 us (47 exp) | 415.6 us (47 exp) | +30.5 |
| 64 | 407.1 us (47 exp) | 450.9 us (48 exp) | +43.8 |
| 128 | 442.5 us (47 exp) | 474.4 us (48 exp) | +31.9 |
| 256 | 455.2 us (47 exp) | 511.1 us (48 exp) | +55.9 |

A linear fit over EP1's M=32..256, where the touched-expert count is already
saturated, gives **375 us + 0.313 us/token**. The 375 us intercept is the weight
stream plus everything that does not scale with tokens. With the weight stream
measured independently at 3.52 TB/s (the expert-count ablation), H200 at M=32
decomposes as:

| part | time | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| weight stream, 1.109 GB at 3.52 TB/s | 316 us | 76 % |
| local fixed cost (launch, grid sync, epilogues, combine) | ~59 us | 14 % |
| cross-rank dispatch + combine + NVLink barriers | ~40 us | 10 % |
| **total** | **415.6 us** | |

The collective is format-independent: it costs FP8, NVFP4 and MXFP4 the same, so
no weight-format work can remove it. That puts a hard ceiling on any
roofline percentage quoted against weight bytes alone.

### 7.2 The load path, measured in isolation

The roofline above assumes the weight bytes move at HBM peak. They did not, and
the reason was not the byte count. Two standalone measurements on the same
H200:

*What the device can actually stream* (torch, 512 MiB buffers): 4.217 TB/s for a
copy, **4.154 TB/s read-only**, against a 4.8 TB/s theoretical peak — so ~87 %
is the practical ceiling, not 100 %.

*What each weight-tile addressing scheme sustains* — a standalone 132-CTA
pipeline that issues the loads and does nothing else
(`tests/bench_sm90_weight_load.cu`, nvcc-only), 1.3-1.6
GB working set, 6 stages:

| addressing | TB/s | bytes/iter |
|---|---:|---:|
| 2D TMA, 80 B rows, `k_blocks * 80` stride (what the kernel did) | **2.769** | 1557 MB |
| 2D TMA, 64 B rows + separate scale row | 3.406 | 1324 MB |
| 1D bulk copy, contiguous 17408 B tile | 4.413 | 1324 MB |
| **1D bulk copy, contiguous 20480 B tile (same bytes as today)** | **4.487** | 1557 MB |
| 1D bulk copy, contiguous 16384 B tile | 4.269 | 1246 MB |

A pipeline stage wanted `BLOCK_N` rows of one k-block, and those rows sat
`k_blocks * 80` bytes apart, so the stage was 256 strided 80-byte requests. That
pattern tops out at **63 % of what the same device streams contiguously**.
Grouping the tile so its rows are adjacent moves the *identical* bytes 1.62x
faster, and needs no change to the shared-memory image the decoder reads.

This also settles the reverted experiment in section 8: its layout was right and
its load instruction was right — the 25-40 % it lost came from elsewhere, not
from the bulk copy.

### 7.3 Where the kernel stands after contiguous tiles

Same H200, same routing, `fp8` as the in-process control (its code is
untouched, and across the two EP1 runs it reproduces to 0.2 %):

| | EP1 M=32 | EP8 M=32 |
|---|---:|---:|
| before | 385.1 us | 415.6 us |
| after | **345.5 us** | **390.3 us** |
| weight bytes (47 experts) | 1.109 GB | 1.109 GB |
| at 4.8 TB/s theoretical | 231 us -> **66.9 %** | 231 us -> **59.2 %** |
| at 4.154 TB/s achievable | 267 us -> **77.2 %** | 267 us -> **68.4 %** |

Backing the weight stream out of the EP1 intercept puts it at **4.01 TB/s, 97 %
of what this device streams**. The load path is closed; what is left above the
roofline is not the GEMM:

Measured directly rather than inferred, by varying the expert count at fixed
M=32 on EP1 — the tile count, and so the weight bytes, scale with experts while
the token-dependent work does not:

| experts touched | time |
|---:|---:|
| 47 | 337.4 us |
| 35 | 265.6 us |
| 23 | 194.9 us |

Both gaps give the same slope to 1.5 % (5.98 / 5.89 us per expert) and the same
intercept from either end, so:

| part | M=32 EP1 | |
|---|---:|---|
| weight stream, 20.06 MB/expert at **3.38 TB/s** | 279 us | |
| fixed cost, independent of the weights | **58 us** | |

The load path on its own sustains **4.4 TB/s** (section 7.2, variant G, and the
same on H20-3e). The kernel only gets 3.38, so **the consumer — decode plus
WGMMA — is throttling the loader by 24 %**; the memory system is not the limit.

Running the real decoder standalone over a resident tile puts the decode at
**490 ns per stage per SM** against the load's 522, which looks like there is no
slack at all. There is: making the decode 10 % cheaper moves the kernel 0.7 %
(section 8), so the decode is in fact mostly hidden. The ~161 ns per stage that
is not hidden is the WGMMA and the synchronisation around it -- consistent with
the narrower transposed tile (section 5.6) being what actually helped.
That is the opposite of what the earlier "97 % of achievable" reading suggested,
which measured the stream in isolation rather than in the kernel.

`ncu` is not installed on any node image these run on, so the phase split came
from `clock64()` timestamps compiled into the kernel behind a macro and read
back with `printf` — diagnostic only, not kept. At M=32 on 78 SMs, EP1, two
independent runs:

| phase | cycles | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| entry -> GEMM end (prologue, dispatch, mainloop) | 990 833 / 992 747 | **91.8 / 91.9 %** |
| combine + workspace cleanup | 88 889 / 87 202 | **8.2 / 8.1 %** |

1 079 722 cycles at ~1.98 GHz is ~545 us against ~503 us of measured wall time,
so the timestamps track the real kernel. **The combine tail is worth at most
8 %**, and it moves ~3 MB, which at 4 TB/s is under a microsecond — so what it
costs is the device-wide barrier in front of it and the latency of its own
chunked loop, not bandwidth. Removing it outright would not reach the target,
which is why the remaining work is not a single change.

The throttle has a model, and it checks out. Per stage per SM at M=32: the load
wants 522 ns (17408 B at the 4.4 TB/s the load path sustains), and the consumer
takes 683 ns (the expert-ablation slope, 5.94 us per expert over 8.7 stages).
If the consumer gates the loader, the stream should run at

    4.4 TB/s * 522 / 683 = 3.36 TB/s

against **3.38 TB/s measured** — 0.6 % apart. So the arithmetic that closes the
target is explicit: **cut 161 ns, 24 %, off the consumer** and the stream reaches
4.4 TB/s, the weight time 279 -> 214 us, and the kernel ~272 us, which is 72 % of
the 196 us roofline.

That 161 ns is now pinned down. A harness that runs the real consumer — the RS
decode feeding the swapAB WGMMA, both halves, as `decode_rs_half` and
`issue_half` do it — reproduces 544 ns of it (the rest is the epilogue, the
barriers and the A/SF loads it omits). Within that:

| consumer variant | ns/stage/SM |
|---|---:|
| as shipped | 545.1 |
| **the same with a free scale lookup** | **484.5** |
| one lookup per row instead of four | 488.6 |
| decode alone, no WGMMA (earlier harness) | 490 |

Three things follow. The **WGMMA adds only ~54 ns** on top of the decode, so the
transposed tile's narrow N is not what costs. The **scale lookup is 60 ns**, and
collapsing four per row into one recovers 56 — but that is only correct when all
four groups in a K-block share an E8M0 exponent, which they generally do not,
and a warp-uniform guard would fire too rarely to pay. And with a **free** lookup
the consumer still costs 484 ns against a 522 ns load.

The lane-pair shuffle is the other 112 ns (21 %), and unlike the decode
reorder the WGMMA does *not* absorb it:

| consumer variant | ns/stage/SM |
|---|---:|
| as shipped | 543.7 |
| without the shuffle (upper bound) | **427.1** |
| shuffle replaced by loading the partner's word | 801.4 |
| ...with only the needed nibble-half computed | 918.5 |

Neither replacement works, and the second explains the first: picking the half
needs `if (keep_hi)`, which diverges the warp. Folding the exchange into the
offline layout looked like the answer — until the reason it exists shows up.
`a_frag[0]` and `a_frag[1]` hold rows `r` and `r+8`, **each dequantised with its
own row's E8M0 scale** before they are exchanged. Folding it offline would need
both rows' nibbles in one word under one LUT, and they do not share a scale. The
427 ns figure is an upper bound that quietly assumes they do. **The shuffle is
load-bearing**: it is what lets per-row scaling coexist with the WGMMA's
two-row fragment layout.

That leaves the dequant ALU — and counting it shows the cost is not the
arithmetic either. Per lane per stage the decode is ~184 instructions (2 halves
x 4 slices x roughly 3 shared loads, 12 ALU, 2 shuffles and the selects). At 8
warps over 4 schedulers that is ~368 issue slots, ~186 ns at 1.98 GHz. It
measures **490**.

That factor of 2.6 looks like latency — one CTA per SM means a scheduler sees
only 3 warps, and each lane has 8 shuffles at ~30 cycles. It is not. Holding the
per-stage decode work fixed and spreading it over more warps:

| threads | warps/sched | ns/stage | 1/N from 256 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 128 | 1.0 | 1284 | 980 |
| 256 | 2.0 | 756 | 490 |
| 384 | 3.0 | 705 | 327 |
| 512 | 4.0 | 600 | 245 |
| 768 | 6.0 | **577** | 163 |
| 1024 | 8.0 | 610 | 123 |

Tripling the warps buys 1.31x, not 3x, and it plateaus near 577 ns — above the
522 ns the load needs, at warp counts the register budget could never afford
beside the math warps anyway. **The decode is throughput-bound on a fixed
resource, not latency-bound.**

Nor is it the byte-permute, which is reduced-rate on some parts and the obvious
suspect. Replacing `prmt` with an XOR of the same instruction count changes
nothing at the 256 threads the kernel actually runs (757 vs 753 ns) and only
helps at warp counts it cannot reach (525 vs 578 at 24 warps). Even with the
permute gone the decode plateaus *at* the 522 ns the load needs, leaving nothing
for the WGMMA and the epilogue that share those warps.

(The scaling harness maps rows to lanes differently from `decode_rs_half`, so
its absolute numbers are not the kernel's. What transfers is the shape of the
curve and the ordering of the variants, which is what the argument rests on.)

That rules out *more* warps. It does not rule out **different** warps, and the
distinction matters: the decode alone is 490 ns, already under the 522 ns load
budget. The consumer is 683 only because the WGMMA (54 ns) and the epilogue and
barriers (139 ns) are serialised onto the same warps. Decoding in warps separate
from the ones issuing the WGMMA would overlap those, and the warp-scaling curve
above says nothing about it — it measured spreading the same decode wider, not
splitting decode from issue.

That restructuring is therefore **open, not closed**. Two things are known about
it. It must hand the decoded tile over through shared memory, and the in-kernel
RS-versus-SS comparison prices that round trip at 6.4 % (336.6 vs 358.2 us at
M=32) — so the split has to beat that handicap before it wins anything. And it
needs roughly 256 decode threads beside the 256 math threads; that fits the
64512-register budget only because SS math warps hold no A fragments and need
far fewer than the 208 the RS path uses.

Estimating it further is not worth much: a harness that forces the two warp
groups into lockstep with `__syncthreads` measures nothing about the overlap,
which is the only thing that would make it pay. It wants building in the kernel,
against the correctness gate. What that takes, having mapped it:

* **640 threads, five warpgroups**: dispatch 64 + loaders 64 (one warpgroup),
  decode 256, math 256. Registers 64x48 + 64x40 + 256x48 + 256x128 = 50688 of
  64512 — it fits only because SS math warps hold no A fragments and need far
  fewer than the RS path's 208. `__launch_bounds__` and
  `SM90MXFP4H200FusedConfig::kNumThreads` both carry 384 today.
* **Shared memory**: 4 packed stages + a 2-slot decoded ring is 136 KB, ~154 KB
  with CD, send buffers, LUT and barriers, against 227 KB. Depth costs nothing
  here (section 8), so trading packed stages for the ring is free.
* **Protocol**: decode warps wait `full_barriers[stage]`, decode into
  `smem_b[k_block & 1]`, then arrive on a new `decoded_full[2]` *and* on
  `empty_barriers[stage]` — that last arrival moves off the math warps, which is
  the point. Math warps wait `decoded_full`, issue the SS WGMMA, arrive
  `decoded_empty[2]`. Both walk the same task stream, so
  `task_info_empty_barriers` init count grows by the decode warps.
* **Watch**: `stage_idx`/`phase` are per-warp copies advanced by
  `advance_pipeline`, so the decode branch gets its own for free;
  `kNumEpilogueWarpgroups` and `WG_BLOCK_N` drive the per-warpgroup N split and
  must stay consistent when the warp indices shift.
* **The hard part, and why this is not a patch-sized job.** The handoff has to
  be split `bar.arrive` / `bar.sync` over the 512 decode+math threads, not a
  `bar.sync` rendezvous: a rendezvous puts the two groups in lockstep, which is
  exactly the serialisation the split exists to remove. That needs a
  non-blocking arrive helper (`bar.arrive`, which `ptx/utils.cuh` does not have
  — it only wraps `bar.sync`/`barrier.sync`), first-iteration special-casing so
  the producer does not wait on an empty slot nobody has released yet, and
  relocating the five `arrive_empty_barrier` sites, which sit *inside* the WGMMA
  issue on purpose so no TMA wait lands in front of them. Every one of those is
  a deadlock rather than a wrong number if it is wrong, so it wants a machine to
  iterate on, not a single patch.

The scaffolding above was built and checked as far as it goes — 640 threads in
five warpgroups, 58368 of 64512 registers, the warp map, the ring barriers and
the gating — and then reverted, because a half-built protocol is worse than
none.

The payoff to expect is ~64 % of the theoretical roofline and ~74 % of the
achievable one, from 59.4 % and 68.6 % — worth doing, but it does not reach
70 % measured against theoretical peak, and no other identified change does
either.

That leaves the floor, and that number is the answer to the whole question. Feeding 4.4 TB/s needs the
dequant to produce 32768 values per 522 ns, about 32 per cycle per SM; it
produces about 34. **MXFP4 on Hopper sits right at the edge of being
dequant-bound** — the format has no FP4 MMA here, so every weight byte is
unpacked in the ALU before it can be multiplied, and that unpacking is as
expensive as fetching it. Even a free lookup leaves the kernel at 64 % of
roofline. Reaching 70-80 % is not a scheduling or layout problem; it needs
either fewer dequantised values per byte of weight, or hardware that multiplies
FP4 directly.

It also resolves why the decode reorder disappointed: 10 % off the decode
*alone* is nothing once the WGMMA is there to overlap with, which is exactly
what both the harness (543.8 vs 544.0) and the kernel (0.7 %) show.

Which roofline the percentage is quoted against decides the verdict, so all
three, M=32, 47 experts touched, 943 MB of weights:

| denominator | floor | EP1 | EP8 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 4.80 TB/s, theoretical HBM peak | 196 us | 59.4 % | 50.3 % |
| 4.40 TB/s, the TMA load path sustains (section 7.2) | 214 us | 64.8 % | 54.9 % |
| **4.154 TB/s, what the part actually streams** | 227 us | **68.6 %** | 58.1 % |

The theoretical peak is not reachable by any kernel here — a plain read stream
measures 4.154 TB/s, 87 % of it — so quoting against it builds in a 13 % penalty
before the kernel does anything. Against what the hardware delivers, the
single-rank kernel is at **68.6 %**, and the 10 points between that and EP8 are
the collective, which is format-independent.

Two levers, both quantified:

| if | M=32 EP1 | vs 196 us theoretical roofline |
|---|---:|---:|
| today | 337 us | 58 % |
| stream reaches the load path's 4.4 TB/s | 272 us | **72 %** |
| ...and the fixed cost halves | 243 us | **81 %** |

Dropping the 12 B of per-row padding on top (chunk-major tiles, section 5.5)
buys much less than its 15 % of bytes suggests — **-3.6 / -1.2 / -2.2 / +0.1 /
+0.1 %** at EP1 M=8..256. Two reasons, both visible in section 7.2's table: at
M>=128 the tier is no longer load-bound, and a smaller bulk copy sustains less
bandwidth (variant D's 16 KB tile runs at 4.27 TB/s where variant E's 20 KB tile
runs at 4.49). It is kept because it is never a regression and it takes 15 % off
the weight footprint itself, which is the point of a 4-bit format.

What is left above the roofline is not the GEMM and not the weight layout.

## 8. Measured and rejected

Recorded so they are not retried:

| idea | result |
|---|---|
| Contiguous weight tiles via one 1D bulk copy **with the scales split out** (64 B rows) | **-25 to -40 %** at H20 M=32-64, while moving 15 % fewer bytes. Section 7.2 later showed the load itself was 1.6x faster, so the loss was on the consumer side: a 64 B shared-memory row stride is 16 words, which 4-way bank-conflicts the decoder's 128-bit loads where 80 B (20 words) is conflict-free. Contiguity alone, keeping the 80 B row, is what shipped |
| Larger weight bulk copies (one 17408 B copy per stage instead of two 8704 B ones, via k-major tile order) | **No gain, and the reorder would have been wasted work.** The standalone pipeline sustains 4.53 TB/s on today's two-copy pattern against 4.34 for one contiguous copy. Measured before implementing |
| Deeper pipelines now that a stage is 17408 B, not 20480 B (10 stages fit where 6-8 did) | **No effect.** Standalone, 4/6/8/10 stages give 4.36/4.48/4.37/4.40 TB/s -- the load path saturates at 4. End-to-end, M=32 gives 336.6/335.5/339.1 us at 6/8/10 and M=64 gives 362.0/362.9 at 8/10. The consumer is not waiting on buffering |
| Decode both packed words before either lane-pair shuffle, so the second is not stuck behind the first shuffle's latency | **10 % off the decode in isolation** (472 -> 432 ns per stage per SM, standalone harness) and **0.7 % end-to-end** at M=32, nil at M=64. The decode's issue cost is largely hidden behind the load and the WGMMA already, so shrinking it buys almost nothing. Reverted -- but the measurement is the useful part: of the ~161 ns per stage that is *not* hidden, the decode is not what it is made of |
| Second dispatch warp (`single_active_dispatch_warp=0`), and experts per wave 48 vs 24 vs 16 | **Nothing**, to 0.12 %: 503.4 / 503.5 / 503.2 / 503.8 us at M=32 on 78 SMs, one process. These were the last two knobs sitting in the ~58 us weight-independent intercept, so that intercept is not reachable by configuration either |
| Deepening the combine's load pipeline past its 2-slot double buffer | **Cannot help, by construction.** At M=32 the 32 tokens are spread over 78 SMs x 8 warps = 624 warps, so ~592 do no combine work at all and only wait. The 8.2 % the phase split attributes to combine is the device-wide barrier that has to precede any reduction -- every rank's GEMM output must be written before any token reduces -- not the chunk loop, which sees at most 16 loads in the few active warps |
| `cp.async.bulk.prefetch.L2` of the k=0 weight tiles while the B loader waits on the routing counts (the weights do not depend on routing, and each CTA takes a slice so the grid covers them once) | **Nothing**: 503.4 -> 506.9 us at M=32 and 581.8 -> 579.3 at M=64, one node, one allocation, baseline and patched back to back. Mixed signs inside the noise band. The routing wait is not long enough for a prefetch to land, which the phase split already implied -- 92 % of the kernel is mainloop |
| Prefetch: decode K+1 under K's in-flight WGMMAs (two decoded slots, `warpgroup_wait<1>`) | **+5.9 / +7.1 / +10.8 %** at MiMo/H20 M=64 over three runs. Its prefetch waits on stage K+1's TMA barrier, and that wait sits between the WGMMA issue and `arrive_empty(K)`, so it delays the loader by exactly what it saves on the decode |
| `--ptxas-options=--register-usage-level=5` | no effect: 168 regs, 0 spill, identical QGMMA/DEPBAR, on both the SS and RS kernels |
| Pipeline depth alone (SS path) | ~1 %, and it flipped sign between runs — inside the drift band, so the shipped depths come from the RS sweep where the effect is outside it |
| BM24 instead of BM16 at M=32, BM16/EPW24/stage variants at M=64 | every alternative was 2-6 % worse than the shipped tier; the selector is at a local optimum for the knobs it exposes |

---

## 9. Results

### 9.1 vs `megamoe_nvfp4_dev_m`, 8x H200, one process, identical routing

`nvfp4` here *is* `megamoe_nvfp4_dev_m` — the files are byte-identical — so this
is a same-process, same-weights, same-router comparison with no cross-run drift
in it at all.

| M | fp8 (us) | mxfp4 (us) | nvfp4 dev_m (us) | mxfp4 vs dev_m | mxfp4 vs fp8 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 177.1 | 172.5 | 185.0 | **-6.8 %** | -2.6 % |
| 8 | 436.7 | 368.3 | 368.6 | -0.1 % | -15.7 % |
| 16 | 490.5 | 417.1 | 416.8 | +0.1 % | -15.0 % |
| 32 | 515.5 | 415.6 | 422.7 | **-1.7 %** | -19.4 % |
| 64 | 542.6 | 450.9 | 465.3 | **-3.1 %** | -16.9 % |
| 128 | 526.3 | 474.4 | 480.2 | **-1.2 %** | -9.9 % |
| 256 | 553.1 | 511.1 | 500.2 | +2.2 % | -7.6 % |

Starting point for the same comparison was +23.9 % to +104.3 % (§2).

### 9.2 vs `megamoe_nvfp4_dev` (`kernel_family="auto"`), 8x H20-3e, A/B/B/A

The two implementations live in different worktrees and cannot share a process,
so whole processes are alternated A/B/B/A and each arm's two passes are averaged.
The node drifts a lot at small M — dev's own two passes differ by 21 % at M=1 and
10 % at M=8 — so only the larger-M rows are tight.

| M | mxfp4 pass 1 / 2 (us) | dev pass 1 / 2 (us) | mean mxfp4 | mean dev | delta |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 161.6 / 163.2 | 171.8 / 141.5 | 162.4 | 156.7 | +3.7 % |
| 8 | 556.4 / 444.6 | 476.1 / 431.6 | 500.5 | 453.9 | +10.3 % |
| 16 | 522.1 / 507.7 | 522.3 / 521.6 | 514.9 | 522.0 | **-1.4 %** |
| 32 | 581.7 / 620.3 | 568.8 / 575.8 | 601.0 | 572.3 | +5.0 % |
| 64 | 637.5 / 640.8 | 611.7 / 596.5 | 639.2 | 604.1 | +5.8 % |
| 128 | 804.1 / 811.5 | 805.7 / 780.9 | 807.8 | 793.3 | +1.8 % |
| 256 | 981.8 / 970.2 | 980.3 / 976.6 | 976.0 | 978.5 | **-0.3 %** |

Before this work the same comparison was +10 % to +23 % across the board. What
remains is concentrated at M=32-64, where `megamoe_nvfp4_dev` additionally
rotates its RS schedule across K-blocks; the intra-stage half of that rotation is
adopted here (§5.3), the cross-stage half was measured and rejected (§6).

### 9.3 Before / after on the same hardware

8x H20-3e, MXFP4 arm only, against the FP8 MegaMoE measured in the same process
(the FP8 column is the drift anchor — it is the same kernel in both rows):

| M | branch as shipped (us) | optimized (us) | speedup | fp8 anchor, shipped run / optimized run |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 205.5 | 139.8 | **1.47x** | 144.9 / 157.7 |
| 8 | 693.4 | 461.1 | **1.50x** | 475.8 / 492.4 |
| 16 | 817.4 | 502.8 | **1.63x** | 543.6 / 556.5 |
| 32 | 969.2 | 602.3 | **1.61x** | 596.7 / 601.2 |
| 64 | 1022.0 | 614.5 | **1.66x** | 677.3 / 653.6 |
| 128 | 1047.0 | 815.3 | **1.28x** | 960.7 / 978.4 |
| 256 | 1060.0 | 970.5 | **1.09x** | 986.3 / 987.7 |

The FP8 MegaMoE is the same kernel in both runs and moves by only 1-4 % between
them, which is what bounds the drift these speedups are measured against.


### 9.4 Contiguous weight tiles, H200

`fp8` runs in the same process and its code is untouched, so the ratio to it
cancels the cross-process drift. `nvfp4` still uses the strided descriptor path
and is the in-process control for the layout change itself.

EP8 / 384 experts, 8x H200:

| M | mxfp4/fp8 before | mxfp4/fp8 after | gain | mxfp4/nvfp4 before | mxfp4/nvfp4 after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 0.843 | 0.726 | **-13.9 %** | 0.999 | **0.916** |
| 16 | 0.850 | 0.717 | **-15.6 %** | 1.001 | **0.860** |
| 32 | 0.806 | 0.725 | **-10.1 %** | 0.983 | **0.897** |
| 64 | 0.831 | 0.741 | **-10.8 %** | 0.969 | **0.881** |
| 128 | 0.901 | 0.820 | **-9.0 %** | 0.988 | 0.974 |
| 256 | 0.924 | 0.871 | **-5.7 %** | 1.022 | **0.945** |

EP1 / 48 experts, 1x H200 — no collective, and the fp8 anchor reproduces to
0.2 % between the two runs, so these are absolute:

| M | before (us) | after (us) | gain | fp8 anchor before / after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 8 | 287.8 | **253.5** | -11.9 % | 356.5 / 357.1 |
| 32 | 385.1 | **345.5** | -10.3 % | 484.6 / 484.7 |
| 64 | 407.1 | **374.8** | -7.9 % | 505.4 / 506.2 |
| 128 | 442.5 | **422.3** | -4.6 % | 496.0 / 497.0 |
| 256 | 455.2 | **433.7** | -4.7 % | 509.5 / 509.4 |

8x H20-3e is **flat** (-0.2 to -2.5 %, inside that node's drift), and that is the
expected result: H20 runs the same weight stream at 1.94 TB/s, 40 % of peak, so
it is bound by its 78 SMs and not by the load. Making the load faster cannot
help a kernel that is not waiting on it.

Correctness after the change: 18/18 over M=1..1024 in both global-scale modes,
cosine 0.9986-0.9990 — unchanged, as a pure byte permutation must be.

### 9.5 Unpadded chunk-major tiles, H200

Measured on top of section 9.4, same method. EP1 / 48 experts, where the fp8
anchor reproduces to 0.3 % across all three trees:

| M | baseline | contiguous | + unpadded | vs contiguous | fp8 anchor |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 8 | 287.8 | 253.5 | **244.5** | -3.6 % | 356.5 / 357.1 / 356.5 |
| 32 | 385.1 | 345.5 | **341.3** | -1.2 % | 484.6 / 484.7 / 484.8 |
| 64 | 407.1 | 374.8 | **366.6** | -2.2 % | 505.4 / 506.2 / 505.8 |
| 128 | 442.5 | 422.3 | 422.8 | +0.1 % | 496.0 / 497.0 / 496.3 |
| 256 | 455.2 | 433.7 | 434.2 | +0.1 % | 509.5 / 509.4 / 508.9 |

EP8 / 384 experts, mxfp4/nvfp4 in one process: 0.859 / 0.848 / 0.911 / 0.855 /
0.968 / 0.928 at M=8..256, against 0.916 / 0.860 / 0.897 / 0.881 / 0.974 / 0.945
for contiguous-only — better at five of six points.

Correctness: 18/18 over M=1..1024 in both global-scale modes, cosine
0.9986-0.9990.

### 9.6 EP4 and EP8 on the shipped stack

The first run of everything together — rank templating, contiguous tiles, the
unpadded chunk-major layout and the tile rule — at the rank counts that ship.
8x H20-3e, `fp8` in the same process as the anchor:

| M | EP4 / 192 experts | | EP8 / 384 experts | |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| | fp8 | mxfp4 | fp8 | mxfp4 |
| 8 | 498.4 | **456.0** (-8.5 %) | 455.1 | **444.5** (-2.3 %) |
| 16 | 524.5 | **482.9** (-7.9 %) | 583.9 | **517.0** (-11.5 %) |
| 32 | 549.3 | **530.3** (-3.5 %) | 581.7 | 604.0 (+3.8 %) |
| 64 | 636.9 | 643.4 (+1.0 %) | 668.5 | **658.3** (-1.5 %) |
| 128 | 933.3 | **812.1** (-13.0 %) | 957.2 | **833.4** (-12.9 %) |
| 256 | 951.5 | **931.4** (-2.1 %) | 1003.0 | **980.5** (-2.3 %) |

EP4 correctness: 10/10 over M=8..256 at 192 experts, which is 48 per rank — the
same per-rank load the EP1 measurements were taken at.

The +3.8 % at EP8 M=32 looked like a regression from the tile rule and is not:
the in-process comparison in section 5.6 has the rule's BM8 **6.1 % ahead** of
BM16 at that exact point on the same part. Between those two EP8 runs the fp8
anchor itself moved 13 % and the router drew a different token count (253 vs
239 received), which is the drift these cross-process numbers carry and why the
selector conclusions all come from in-process arms.

### 9.7 Large M — the tier this work does not touch

Above `swap_ab_max_tokens` the selector falls to BM64, and above M=256 to the
BM128/BN128 split-M tier. Both are still **one fused megakernel**; this branch
has no split L1/L2 kernel family at all, which is what `megamoe_nvfp4_dev`
switches to for M >= 257.

8x H200, one process:

| M | fp8 (us) | mxfp4 (us) | nvfp4 dev_m (us) | mxfp4 vs dev_m | mxfp4 vs fp8 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 512 | 888.9 | 813.4 | 808.6 | +0.6 % | **-8.5 %** |
| 1024 | 1197.4 | 1534.0 | 1545.0 | **-0.7 %** | +28.1 % |
| 2048 | 1872.7 | 2387.0 | 2391.0 | **-0.2 %** | +27.5 % |

8x H20-3e (nvfp4 cannot run, 132 SMs hardcoded):

| M | fp8 (us) | mxfp4 (us) | mxfp4 vs fp8 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 512 | 1874.1 | 2209.0 | +17.9 % |
| 1024 | 2858.0 | 4337.0 | +51.8 % |
| 2048 | 5406.0 | 6640.0 | +22.8 % |

MXFP4 tracks `dev_m` to within 0.7 % here, as expected — none of §5 applies to
these tiers. The real statement is the FP8 column: **past M ~ 512 the fused FP4
path is the wrong kernel**, for the reason in §7 (no FP4 MMA on Hopper, so the
dequant is pure overhead once compute-bound). Closing that needs either a split
family or a large-M tile, not more dequant work.

A regression was found here and fixed: threading an explicit decoded-slot index
through `decode_b_stage` (§5.2) had pinned the BM128 split-M tier to slot 0,
losing the alternation its paired warpgroups rely on. It failed at M=512 with
cosine 0.8966 and passes at 0.9989-0.9990 after the fix — the same value every
other tier reports. **This tier had never been exercised by the small-M sweeps.**

### 9.8 Attribution, in-process where possible

| change | measurement | effect |
|---|---|---|
| shared-memory LUT window (§5.1) | H20, full sweep, fp8-anchored, two runs | **-27 to -33 %** at M=8..64 |
| decoded-B ring + combine floor (§5.2) | H20, in-process stage sweep | perf-neutral at fixed depth; removes 64 KB of dead shared memory and lifts the depth ceiling |
| RS operand (§5.3) | H20, in-process arms, identical routing | -6.7 % (M=8), -4.2 % (M=32), -2.1 % (M=64), -6.5 % (M=128, where it also beats the BM64 tier) |
| intra-stage half overlap (§5.3) | H20, fp8-anchored | M=64 went from +4.2 % to -6.0 % against fp8 |
| cross-K-block decode prefetch | H20, in-process arms | **rejected**: -2.4 % at M=64 but +5.5..6.7 % at M=32 and +13.3 % at M=8. Same mechanism as the SS rotation in §6 — the prefetch's stage-barrier wait lands in front of `arrive_empty`, and only at BM24 is the decode long enough to pay for it. A single-tier 2 % at the edge of the drift band is not worth a fourth schedule flag |
| tile/stage selection (§5.4) | H200, in-process | fixed a +22.9 % regression at M=128 that the shape-only rule had introduced |

---

### 9.7 Decode in its own warps, and two tile-selection cliffs it exposed

Three commits, all on H20-3e (78 SMs), MiMo shape, measured with matched
`BLOCK_M` arms inside one process unless stated.

**a4cba25 — decode/issue split.** The swapAB mainloop decoded each weight tile
on the math warps, so the decode and the WGMMA it feeds ran back to back. Decode
now owns 256 threads and hands tiles over a two-stage mbarrier ring.

It is *not* a uniform win, which is the useful part:

| BLOCK_M | WGMMA/tile | split vs RS |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 28 | **+2.4 .. +3.0 %** (loses) |
| 16 | 56 | -3.8 .. -7.7 % |
| 24 | 84 | -4.0 .. -6.3 % |

The split trades a shared-memory round trip for warp-level overlap, so it pays
only where the WGMMA is long enough to hide the decode. `BLOCK_M 8` issues a
third as many WGMMAs as 24 and the round trip dominates, so that tier keeps
decoding on the math warps — gated in the kernel by
`sm90_mxfp4_split_decode(swap_ab, use_rs, block_m)`, not only in the heuristic,
because a pre-existing H200 rule sets `rs_swap_ab=false` at BM8 and was measured
against the *old* meaning of that flag.

**The deadlock was register over-subscription, not the protocol.** `setmaxnreg`
reserves registers per warp in 256-register granules, so the budget is
`65536 / warps / 256 * 256 * warps` — 64512 at 384 threads but **61440 at 640**
— and it is charged per *warpgroup*, so dispatch (48) sharing a warpgroup with
the loaders (64) costs `64 * 128`, not `48*64 + 64*64`. Both were wrong in the
assert. An over-subscribed `warpgroup_reg_alloc` does not fail the launch, it
**blocks**, which presents exactly like a producer/consumer deadlock:

| epilogue regs | total | result |
|---:|---:|:--|
| 152 | 59392 | passes |
| 168 | 63488 | hangs |
| 176 | 65536 | hangs |

**9849545 and 4b67d03 — the tile bound is a mean.** `max_tokens_for_block_m`
divides routed slots by experts, but a tile has to hold the *busiest* expert.
Near the top of any tile's nominal range enough experts overflow it to need the
second m-block the rule exists to avoid, so the plan falls off a cliff exactly
where the rule still prefers it:

| tile | nominal bound | measured cost near the top |
|---:|---:|---:|
| BM8 | 48 | +19 % at M=40, +23 % at M=48 |
| BM16 | 96 | +10 % at M=64, +40 % at M=96 |

BM16 is dropped from the candidate list outright and the bound derated by 3/4,
putting the BM8/BM24 crossover at M=36 — between the measured M=32 where BM8
still wins by 7.5 % and M=40 where it loses by 9.7 %. The signature to
recognise is latency *jumping* with M while the wider tile stays flat: BM8 goes
574.6 -> 688.6 us from M=32 to M=40 while BM24 goes 617.5 -> 621.8.

**End to end**, versus the recorded pre-change baseline:

| | M=40 | M=48 | M=64 | M=96 | M=128 |
|:--|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| EP8 before | 688.6 | 702.6 | 658.3 | 972.4 | 833.4 |
| EP8 after | **570.0** | **567.7** | **587.7** | **693.4** | **780.2** |
| EP4 after | | | **573.4** | **646.9** | **783.9** |

Correctness is unchanged at EP1, EP4 and EP8 (cosine_min 0.9988-0.9989).

**Caveat on the numbers.** Same-config arms in one EP8 process have read 653.8
and 680.0 us; the same M=128 plan has read 780.6, 781.3, 788.0, 792.4 and 841.4
across runs. Treat the ~4 % band as noise and trust only matched-`BLOCK_M`
in-process arms — every delta quoted above is one of those, except the
before/after table, which is cross-run.

### 9.8 Where this sits against SOL

At the best-understood point (EP8, M=128, 780.2 us) each GPU streams 48 local
experts x 20.1 MB = 963 MB of MXFP4 weights and does 78.5 GFLOP:

| | achieved | roofline | fraction |
|:--|---:|---:|---:|
| weight read | 1.23 TB/s | 4.154 TB/s measured device stream | **30 %** |
| compute | 100.6 TF | ~296 TF H20 FP8 peak | **34 %** |

Both are well short of the 70-80 % target, and neither denominator accounts for
dispatch and combine over NVLink, which are inside the measured time. Quoting a
single roofline percentage for this kernel is what produced the retracted claims
in section 7; the honest next step is to re-establish the three-way split
(weight stream / local compute / collective) at these new operating points
before choosing the next lever, since the tile changes moved which plan runs at
every M below 128.

---

### 9.9 What actually throttles the stream, and the real ceiling

Section 9.8 quoted 30-34 % of roofline. That denominator was wrong in two ways,
and fixing both changes the conclusion.

**The collective is not the problem.** Templating on `kNumRanks` makes EP1
runnable, so the collective can be differenced out directly at matched per-GPU
work (H20-3e, 48 local experts either way):

| M | EP1 | EP8 | collective |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 | 503.5 | 593.5 | 90.0 us |
| 64 | 545.9 | 587.7 | 41.8 |
| 128 | 700.6 | 780.2 | 79.6 |
| 256 | 917.8 | 942.0 | 24.2 |

3-15 %. EP1, with no collective at all, still runs at 37-57 % of roofline, so
the gap is in the GEMM.

**The weight stream is consumer-throttled, and the consumer is the dequant.**
Ablating the expert count at M=8 (where compute/expert is 2.0 us against
4.6 us of memory, so the slope is a pure stream read) gives 8.75 us/expert on
the best schedule = **2.29 TB/s, 52 % of the 4.4 TB/s load path**.
`tests/bench_sm90_decode_consumer.cu` attributes that deficit by running the
shipped loader with progressively more of the real consumer:

| consumer | TB/s | vs loader |
|:--|---:|---:|
| loader alone | 4.19 | — |
| + dequant ALU only | 2.90 | -30 % |
| + shared store only | 3.19 | -24 % |
| + both (the SS decode) | 2.39 | -43 % |

2.39 reproduces the in-kernel 2.10-2.39 almost exactly, which is the
attribution: **the decode, not the WGMMA, not barriers, not the collective.**
The WGMMA is not the binding term either -- issue time for an L1 CTA is 6.6 us
against 14.8 us of its HBM share.

**So ~70 % of the load path is the ceiling, not a target.** The dequant ALU
alone costs 30 %, and it is unavoidable: Hopper has no FP4 MMA, so every weight
byte is expanded to FP8 before the tensor core can see it. The RS path, which
skips the shared store, is the closest to that ceiling -- 2.29 of a possible
2.90, i.e. 79 % -- and the missing 21 % is decode that is not hidden behind an
MMA.

**That last 21 % is structurally blocked.** The mainloop already pipelines at
half granularity, so half 1's decode hides under half 0's MMA and only half 0's
is exposed. Hiding it too needs the *previous* k-block's MMA still in flight,
but `warpgroup_wait<0>` has to drain before `arrive_empty(K)` releases the
stage; moving the decode ahead of that wait is the next-stage prefetch already
measured and rejected in section 8. The halves cannot be subdivided either --
they are 64-row WGMMA M groups, which is the instruction minimum. The quad-ILP
decode variant measures identically (2.39), so that knob is spent.

Quoted honestly, then: against the load path the kernel is at **55 % of a
69 % ceiling**. Reaching 70-80 % of the *HBM* roofline is not available to W4A8
on this part at these shapes; it needs an FP4 MMA (Blackwell), or enough tokens
per expert to amortise the expansion over a wider WGMMA -- which is exactly
what the tile rules in 9.7 now do wherever routing allows.

---

### 9.10 Ruled out: finer decode/MMA grouping on the RS path

9.9 left one candidate for the 21 % of the RS path that is decode not hidden
behind an MMA. The mainloop decodes all four k-step slices of a half and then
issues four MMAs, so half 0's decode is exposed and only half 1's hides.
Grouping more finely should hide more of it, for one extra fence/commit pair
per group. `tests/bench_sm90_rs_interleave.cu` runs exactly that comparison --
same loader, same 48 MMAs, only the grouping differs:

| grouping | TB/s |
|:--|---:|
| `kGroupK=4`, decode half then 4 MMA (shipped) | 2.35 |
| `kGroupK=2`, two groups per half | 2.40 (+2.1 %) |
| `kGroupK=1`, interleaved per k-step | **2.13 (-9.4 %)** |

Reproducible to two decimal places over three runs. The aggressive form is a
**regression** -- the fences cost more than the overlap wins -- and the mild one
sits inside the kernel's own noise floor (~4 % at EP8), so it could not be
validated in-kernel even if shipped. I had implemented `kGroupK=1` and predicted
+27 % from a model that ignored fence cost; the measurement says otherwise and
the change was reverted.

The half-granularity grouping already in the mainloop is the right trade. With
this and the thread-count sweep in 9.9 (decode peaks at 256 threads and is
slower at 512, so it is ALU-throughput-bound, not latency-bound), the consumer
side is closed: **the 69 % ceiling stands and the RS path's 79 % of it is what
this shape allows.**

---

### 9.11 Ruled out: the split on the straight BM64 tier

At M>=160 the selector leaves swapAB for the straight BM64 tile, and there the
measured time matches **compute + decode**, not max(compute, decode):

| M | measured | compute | decode | sum |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 160 | 911.5 | 326 | 325 | 651 |
| 192 | 914.2 | 392 | 325 | 717 |
| 256 | 920.7 | 522 | 325 | 847 |

That is the signature of a decode that does not overlap its WGMMA, and this
tier decodes on the math warps because `sm90_mxfp4_split_decode()` required
swapAB. Extending the split to it predicted M=256 at ~600 us, i.e. 87 % of the
compute roofline. Measured instead: correctness passes 4/4 and **every point is
57 % slower** -- 1434 / 1438 / 1447 us.

The cause is the register budget, and it generalises. The split costs 256
threads, and the budget is granted per warp in 256-register granules, so the
epilogue's share falls with the wider launch:

| launch | budget | epilogue after loaders + decode |
|:--|---:|---:|
| 384 threads (no split) | 64512 | <= 220 regs/thread |
| 640 threads (split) | 61440 | **<= 176** |

BM64/BN256 holds `float final_accum[64]` per thread and runs at 208, so under
the split it spills. Reverted.

A narrower retry -- 128 decode threads instead of 256, a 512-thread launch whose
`setmaxnreg` budget still reaches 200 -- looked like it fitted on paper. It does
not, and `ptxas -v` says so without needing the GPU:

| BM64 build | static registers | spill |
|:--|---:|---:|
| 384 threads (shipped) | **168** | 0 |
| 512 threads (split) | **128** | 128 B |

The binding constraint is not the `setmaxnreg` budget but ptxas's *static*
allocation, which is simply `65536 / threads`. So a tier's widest possible
launch is `65536 / (registers it needs)`:

| tier | static regs | max threads | split needs |
|:--|---:|---:|---:|
| BM8/16/24 swapAB | ~100 | 640 | 640 -- fits |
| BM64/BN256 straight | 168 | **384** | 512 -- no |
| BM128/BN128 split-M | 168 | **384** | 512 -- no |

**BM64 is already at its ceiling: it cannot afford one extra warp.** That is the
general rule -- the split is available only to tiers whose epilogue is small
enough to leave room for 4 or 8 more warps, which is exactly the swapAB family.
Check it with `nvcc -Xptxas -v` before trying; it costs nothing and needs no
allocation.

So the tier boundary at `swap_ab_max_tokens` is also confirmed right rather
than under-derated: forcing BM64 below it costs 53 % at M=96 and 32 % at M=128,
and forcing BM24 above it costs 17 % at M=192 and 34 % at M=256. The crossover
sits at M~160 against a bound of 144 -- slightly conservative, correctly placed.

---

### 9.12 Correction: the ceiling, measured with the loader in its own warp

Sections 9.8-9.9 quoted a 69 % ceiling from `bench_sm90_decode_consumer.cu`.
That benchmark has thread 0 issue the next bulk copy only *after* the decode
returns, so it prices decode and load **serialised** -- which is not how the
kernel runs. `tests/bench_sm90_warp_specialised_decode.cu` puts the loader in
its own warp, as the kernel does, and then adds the WGMMA consumer:

| stage | TB/s |
|:--|---:|
| loader alone | 4.16 |
| + dequant, 8 decode warps | **3.09** |
| + dequant, 4 decode warps | 2.48 |
| + WGMMA consuming the decoded tile | **2.31** |
| kernel: SS split / RS | 2.10 / **2.29** |

Two corrections fall out. The decode hides far better than the serialised
figure suggested -- 3.09, not 2.39. But the WGMMA consumer costs 0.78 TB/s on
top, and against that the kernel is at **91-99 % of achievable**, not the 79 % I
reported.

And the binding resource is **shared-memory bandwidth, not the dequant ALU**.
Per stage the SS path moves ~100 KB of smem -- 17 KB TMA write, 17 KB decode
read, 32 KB decode write, 32 KB WGMMA read -- against 17 KB of HBM, a 5.75x
amplification. This also explains a result that looked odd in 9.9: the
register-source path sustains a *higher* stream rate (2.29 vs 2.10) because it
skips the decoded-tile round trip, yet the split still wins end-to-end at
BM16/24 because it overlaps decode with the WGMMA. Different quantities.

So the conclusion in 9.9 was right but for the wrong reason, and the margin is
smaller than stated: there is no ~20 % of un-hidden decode to reclaim. The
pipeline is at its shared-memory limit, and the distance to the HBM roofline is
the W4A8-on-Hopper tax -- ALU expansion plus a shared-memory round trip that no
FP4-MMA-less part can avoid.

---

### 9.13 Where the kernel stands, and the one lever left

With the pipeline limit measured correctly (9.12: 2.31 TB/s for loader warp +
dequant + WGMMA consumer), the achievable roofline is
`max(compute at 296 TF, weights at 2.31 TB/s)`:

| | M=8 | M=16 | M=32 | M=64 | M=128 | M=256 |
|:--|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| EP8 % of achievable | 75 | 78 | 69 | 71 | **53** | 54 |
| EP4 % of achievable | 84 | 84 | 77 | 73 | **53** | 57 |

Across M=8-64 the kernel runs at **69-84 % of achievable**, which is the band
this work was aimed at. The outlier is M=128.

**Why M=128 is the worst point.** At EP8 it routes 21.7 tokens to the average
expert against a BM24 tile, so the lumpy tail overflows and those experts need a
second m-block, doubling their share of the weight stream -- the same
mean-vs-busiest effect as 9.7, one tier up. BM64 is not the answer: forcing it
there costs 32 % (9.11). What is missing is a tile *between* 24 and 64.

**BM32 is feasible and untested.** `FP8MMASelector` accepts N=32, and the only
things stopping it are two template asserts -- the BLOCK_M whitelist and
`!kSwapABRequested || BLOCK_M <= 24`, whose message ("only selected through the
M64 bucket") records a selection convention, not a hardware limit. Relaxing both
compiles a BM32 swapAB + split kernel at **96 registers with zero spill**, the
same as BM24. At M=128/EP8 it would hold 21.7 tokens in one m-block at 68 %
occupancy instead of spilling the tail into a second BM24 block.

This is prepared, not shipped: it needs the two asserts relaxed, BM32 added to
`swap_ab_block_m`'s candidate list with its own `max_tokens_for_block_m` bound,
a gate row, and then correctness plus a matched-BLOCK_M A/B at M=96/128/144 on
EP1, EP4 and EP8. It was not committed because no hardware was available to
validate it, and two changes this session that looked equally sound on paper
(9.10, 9.11) measured as regressions.

### 9.14 Scope correction: everything above only describes M <= 256

Sections 9.7-9.13 sweep M = 8..256 and quote 69-84 % of achievable. **That
framing does not describe the large-M region at all**, and the reason is a bug,
not a gap in the measurements.

The tier rule sent `num_tokens > 256` to the BM128/BN128 split-M plan. That 256
was a bare constant sitting among bounds otherwise derived from
`experts / (ranks * topk)`, and the plan it selects loses to the straight BN256
tile at **every** batch measured, on both shapes (EP4, H20-3e):

| M | MiMo before | MiMo after | DSv4-Flash before | DSv4-Flash after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 384 | 2200 | **1455** | 1963 | **880** |
| 512 | 2256 | **1825** | 1964 | **874** |
| 768 | 3367 | **2332** | 1981 | **1514** |
| 1024 | | | 1995 | **1670** |
| 1536 | | | 3840 | **2429** |
| 2048 | | | 3953 | **2923** |

Against FP8 that is a **22-112 % loss turned into parity or a small win**.
Fixed in e2c99d4 by never selecting the plan; it stays reachable through
`DG_MXFP4_BLOCK_M=128`.

**Two process failures are worth recording, because both were avoidable.**

First, section 8 already noted "at M>=1024 the fused FP4 path loses to FP8 by
~20 %" and filed it as a property of the large-M tier. It was this bug, visible
the whole time, mistaken for a known limitation instead of investigated.

Second, the shape. `is_supported_shape()` admits DeepSeek-V4-Flash
(4096 / 2048 / 256 experts / topk 6) and says so in a comment, but
`tests/compile_all_megamoe_kernels.sh` hardcoded MiMo's dimensions in
`mxfp4_src()`, so **every gate row tested one shape**. A second shape was
declared supported and never instantiated, which is exactly how a 2.1x
regression survived in it. The gate now carries DSv4-Flash rows.

Verified on the default selector path after rebuilding `_C.so`, not through an
env override: DSv4-Flash M=384 1938 -> 883 us and M=512 1941 -> 876; MiMo M=384
2165 -> 1449 and M=512 2194 -> 1835. Against FP8, +116/+115/+47/+19 % became
-2.2/-4.2/-2.9/-3.3 %.

**A third process failure, caught only because that re-measurement was run.**
The selector lives in host code inside `_C.so`. The first "after" numbers were
taken with the fix committed, the compile gate green, and the extension *not
rebuilt* -- so they showed no change at all. `tests/compile_all_megamoe_kernels.sh`
instantiates device templates; it is structurally incapable of testing a host
heuristic. Every selector change in this document was gated by something that
could not have caught a selector bug. **Changes to
`csrc/jit_kernels/heuristics/` need a default-path benchmark, not the gate.**

The generalisable rule: **a tuning bound that is not derived from the shape is a
latent bug in any kernel whose shape is a template parameter.** Every other
bound in the selector derives from `experts / (ranks * topk)`; the one that did
not is the one that broke, and it broke both models rather than only the
untuned one.

---

### 9.15 Ruled out: BLOCK_M 32 for the swapAB tile

9.13 proposed BM32 for the band where tokens per expert pass 24 and experts
spill into a second m-block. On DeepSeek-V4-Flash / EP4 that band is M = 193..256
and MXFP4 loses 5-7 % to FP8 there, while the wide BN256 tile is 21-45 % worse
(so the tier bound is correctly placed -- forcing BN256 at M=160 costs 45 %).

BM32 **deadlocks**. Enabling it needs four separate guards opened:

| guard | where |
|:--|:--|
| `BLOCK_M == 8/16/24/64/128` | kernel `DG_STATIC_ASSERT` |
| `!kSwapABRequested \|\| BLOCK_M <= 24` | kernel `DG_STATIC_ASSERT` |
| `config.block_m == 8/16/24/64/128` | host `DG_HOST_ASSERT` |
| `plan.swap_ab ? block_m <= 24 : ...` | host `DG_HOST_ASSERT` |

With all four open it compiles at **96 registers, zero spill**, passes a 19-row
compile gate, and then hangs on hardware -- NCCL watchdog timeout at 600 s,
M=224, EP4. So `BLOCK_M <= 24` on the swapAB path is a real invariant, enforced
redundantly, and at least one of those guards protects something no
`static_assert` expresses. The comment on the fourth ("the reference NVFP4
selector packs into a larger batch above M=64") reads like an inherited policy;
it is not. Reverted.

**Third static-check false positive this session.** Register over-subscription
compiled and hung (9.9); the compile gate could not see a host selector bug
(9.14); BM32 passed every static check and deadlocked. On this kernel, a clean
compile plus a green gate is weak evidence -- only a default-path run on
hardware settles anything.

The +5-7 % at M=256 on DeepSeek-V4-Flash therefore **remains unexplained**. It is
not the tier bound, and not reachable with a 32-wide tile; it coincides exactly
with tokens per expert crossing 24. Any fix is deeper than tile selection.

---

### 9.16 The residual, localised: tokens per expert crossing 24

The 5-7 % at M=256 on DeepSeek-V4-Flash / EP4 (9.15) is not isolated. At EP8 the
same shape loses at **M=128**, and three runs at `--num-tests 30 --reps 5` show
it is real where a neighbouring point is not:

| M | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 | verdict |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|:--|
| 8 | -21.2 % | -0.1 % | +11.3 % | **noise** -- 32-point spread |
| 32 | -5.0 % | +0.6 % | -1.0 % | noise |
| 128 | **+9.1 %** | **+5.2 %** | **+6.9 %** | **real** |
| 256 | -1.8 % | -1.7 % | +1.5 % | noise |

A single run of this sweep had read M=8 as a +9.7 % regression and M=128 as
+3.5 %. The first was noise and the second understated. **At EP8 nothing below
about 10 % is a finding without repeats** -- the floor recorded in 9.7 was
measured and then ignored in practice.

**The mechanism is the same at both EP widths.** `experts / (ranks * topk)`
halves from EP4 to EP8, so the point where tokens per expert crosses 24 moves
from M~256 to M~128. There BM24 must spill the busiest experts into a second
m-block. It is still the best tile available -- BM16 costs +22 %, BM8 +77 %, the
wide BN256 tile +21-45 % -- so this is not a mis-set bound.

The right-sized tile is BM32. **9.15 was wrong to call its deadlock a real
invariant** -- see 9.17. It is now enabled and the spike is gone.

**The tier bound is not the problem, and a same-M test is what settles it.**
Mapping M = 80..160 shows M=144 running 7 % *faster* than M=128 despite more
tokens per expert, which looks like a refutation -- but 128 and 144 run
*different plans* (swapAB and wide BN256), so that comparison crosses a plan
boundary and tests nothing. Forcing the wide tile at the same M is the clean
test, and it is worse at every point: M=96 +27 %, M=112 +14 %, M=128 +3.6 %.
BM24 is the best available tile at M=128 (461 us, against wide 478, BM16 558,
BM8 813). The boundary sits where it should.

Pooling every EP8 measurement of M=128 taken today: **+3.5, +9.1, +5.2, +6.9,
+10.3, +9.5, +3.5 %** -- positive 7 of 7, mean ~+6.9 %. The sign is solid even
where the magnitude is not, which is the standard this shape's noise demands.

---

### 9.17 BM32, and why it appeared to be forbidden

9.15 concluded that `BLOCK_M <= 24` on the swapAB path is "a real invariant,
enforced redundantly". That was wrong, and the way it was wrong is the useful
part.

**Defect 1 -- a missing arm in the N_SWAP dispatch ladder.** Both mainloops
select the WGMMA width with

    if constexpr (BLOCK_M == 8)       { ...<8>(); }
    else if constexpr (BLOCK_M == 16) { ... }
    else if constexpr (BLOCK_M == 24) { ... }

and there was no `== 32` arm. Being `if constexpr`, a BM32 kernel **compiles
perfectly with an empty mainloop**: no WGMMA, and -- fatally --
`arrive_empty_barrier(stage_idx)` lives inside that lambda, so no stage is ever
released and the loader blocks forever. That is the 600 s hang. Four guards had
accumulated around the hole; the comment on one of them, dismissed in 9.15 as
stale policy, was closer to right than the correction.

An `if constexpr` ladder with no trailing `else` turns an unhandled case into a
silent empty body, which in a warp-specialised kernel is a deadlock rather than
a build error. A trailing `DG_STATIC_ASSERT` now closes it.

**Defect 2 -- the fallback returned the narrowest tile.** Past every derated
bound `swap_ab_block_m` returned 24. That was correct while the candidates were
`{8, 24}`, and became a bug the moment 32 joined them: at M=128 / EP8 on
DeepSeek-V4-Flash, BM32's derated bound is 127, the batch misses it by one, and
the fallback handed back a *narrower* tile than the one available. Past all
bounds the widest tile is the least bad -- it spills the busiest experts into
the fewest extra m-blocks.

**Result at the spike** (EP8, DeepSeek-V4-Flash, two runs each):

| M | before | after |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 112 | -4.3 / -5.5 % | **-14.3 / -15.4 %** |
| 128 | **+10.5 / +7.2 %** | **-22.6 / -16.8 %** |
| 144 | -5.6 / -5.3 % | -1.9 / -4.6 % |
| 160 | -3.9 / -3.1 % | -5.7 / -6.5 % |

M=128 absolute: 467/479 us -> 362/361, a 24 % cut, with no neighbour regressed.
Correctness 8/8 on DSv4 EP8, DSv4 EP4 and MiMo EP4, cosine_min unchanged.

**Three mechanisms were proposed and refuted before this one**: tokens crossing
24 into a second m-block (refuted by a same-M control -- the wide tile is worse
at M=128), the tier bound being one step late (same control), and BM32 being
structurally forbidden (refuted by reading the ladder). Each was plausible; only
the same-M measurement and the source settled it.

---

### 9.18 Final state, both shapes, both EP widths

All figures MXFP4 versus FP8 on the fused MegaMoE, H20-3e, 78 SMs, after e2c99d4
(tier bound) and 3287cfb (BM32 + fallback). Negative is MXFP4 faster.

| M | DSv4-Flash EP4 | DSv4-Flash EP8 | MiMo EP4 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | -2.1 % | noise (+/-10 %) | |
| 32 | +1.4 % | -1.0 % | |
| 64 | +3.4 % | | -9.4 % |
| 96 | | -6.2 / -11.7 % | -15.4 % |
| 112 | | -14.3 / -15.4 % | |
| 128 | -7.8 % | **-22.6 / -16.8 %** | **-30.5 %** |
| 160 | | -5.7 / -6.5 % | -1.9 % |
| 192 | -11.6 % | | -2.4 % |
| 256 | **-15.7 %** | | -3.1 % |
| 384 | -4.1 % | | -2.9 % |
| 512 | -3.5 % | | -3.3 % |
| 768 | -0.3 % | | -1.0 % |

**What the two fixes were worth.** The tier bound took M >= 384 from +22..+116 %
to roughly parity on both shapes. BM32 took the boundary spikes from +5..+10 %
to -16..-30 %: at EP4 the derated bounds are BM8 64, BM24 192, BM32 256, so
BM32 covers M = 193..256 -- exactly the band that measured +5-7 % and was
recorded in 9.16 as unexplained. At EP8 the same bounds halve and it covers
M = 97..127 plus the fallback at 128.

Only M=32 and M=64 at EP4 remain marginally positive (+1.4 / +3.4 %), inside
this shape's run-to-run spread; earlier runs of the same points read -1.9 and
-3.4 %.

**Scope of the earlier SOL claims.** Sections 9.7-9.13 measured M <= 256 on MiMo
only and are not a statement about either shape at larger batches, nor about
DeepSeek-V4-Flash at all. The two defects above were live throughout that work
and cost MiMo 22-49 % at M = 384..768 and 17 % at M = 128 while it was being
reported as a win.

---

### 9.19 The decode loop in SASS, and what it says the ceiling is

Disassembling the DSv4-Flash BM32 swapAB+split instantiation isolates the decode
loop at 199 instructions per 128 output bytes per thread. Five candidates came
out of reading it; four were already optimal and are recorded here so they do
not get retried:

* The eight swizzled shared-memory store addresses are **hoisted out of the
  loop** by ptxas -- `IADD3 Rx, Rbase, URn, R{35,34,33,32,7,6,5,3}`, one add per
  store. Strength-reducing the XOR swizzle to an incremental chain saves nothing.
* The four packed-FP4 loads already use immediate offsets off one base
  (`[R30]`, `[R30+0x800]`, `[R30+0x1000]`, `[R30+0x1800]`).
* The dequant core is **7 instructions per 8 output bytes and irreducible**: the
  `& 0x77777777` selector mask is forced because a PRMT selector nibble with
  bit 3 set means sign-replication, and PRMT can only address 8 source bytes, so
  the sign has to be OR'd back separately.
* `IMAD.SHL.U32 Rd, Ra, 0x10` is a multiply by sixteen, i.e. the `packed << 4`
  of the sign path -- not a second shift.

The one real target was the scaled LUT being a 32-entry *window*: legal only
with a clamped index, which cost two `VIMNMX` and a subtract per lookup, twelve
instructions per iteration over four slices. Storing all 256 entries costs 1 KB
more shared memory and none of that arithmetic -- 199 -> 188 instructions at 96
registers, scale indexing down to a shift and a mask with the times-eight folded
into the shift.

**The MegaMoE harness cannot measure a change that size.** Paired runs of the
*same* binary drift 0.3-6.2 points (M=8 read -4.64 % and -10.85 %). The decode
microbenchmark can: three runs each, no spread, dequant ALU 2.91 -> 3.00 TB/s and
the shared-memory decode 2.39 -> 2.43 TB/s. That benchmark serialises decode
behind the load, so it over-weights ALU savings -- see 9.21. For sub-2 % dequant work that is the
only instrument; the end-to-end number is ~1 point and stays inside the drift.

### 9.20 The tile bound was one step too late, and the model for why is wrong

An expert that overflows its tile is expensive out of proportion to the tokens
that spilled: work is decomposed `num_m_blocks * num_n_blocks` per expert, so the
second m-block re-streams and re-decodes the whole weight slice, and the decode
is the throttle. Padding an under-filled tile costs nothing against that, because
the N_SWAP ladder picks the WGMMA width from `valid_m` -- a BM32 tile holding 18
tokens issues exactly the wgmma a BM24 tile would.

BM24 against BM32 at the same M, two runs per point:

| config | M | lambda | BM24 | BM32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| DSv4 EP4 | 192 | 18.8 | -9.9 % | **-14.1 %** |
| DSv4 EP4 | 256 | 24.5 | +2.8 % | **-15.8 %** |
| DSv4 EP8 | 96 | 17.7 | -8.1 % | **-13.0 %** |
| DSv4 EP8 | 128 | 23.9 | +9.4 % | **-11.9 %** |
| MiMo EP4 | 240 | 19.8 | -26.8 % | **-33.6 %** |

The cliff tracks lambda, not M or shape: BM24 collapses once lambda passes ~18-20.
The old bound sat at exactly `lambda/block_m = 0.75`, on the edge, and both DSv4
configurations sat *at* their bound and already lost. Seven tenths clears it and
moves three points and nothing else -- DSv4 EP4 M=192 -9.9 -> -13.1 %, DSv4 EP8
M=96 -8.1 -> -11.4 %, MiMo EP4 M=216 -32.7 -> -35.3 %.

**The headroom stays a constant fraction, and that was measured rather than
assumed.** Routing spread looks like it should scale as sqrt(lambda), which would
give narrow tiles proportionally more headroom. It does not: sizing for
`lambda + 2.5 sqrt(lambda)` cuts BM8 to 36 tokens on DSv4 EP4, where BM8 still
wins by 9-10 % out to M=48 and does not cross over until M=64. MoE routing
imbalance is learned and correlated, so its spread tracks the mean, not its root.

### 9.21 Why DSv4-Flash does not reach 30 %, and MiMo does

DSv4 EP4 after the above, H20-3e, two runs, negative is MXFP4 faster:

| M | 8 | 32 | 64 | 128 | 160 | 192 | 256 | 384 | 768 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| | -9.4 | -5.1 | -1.6 | -9.5 | -13.1 | **-17.1** | **-17.6** | -4.0 | -0.9 |

Converted to achieved weight-stream bandwidth (weights are 25.17 MB/expert in
FP8, 13.37 MB in MXFP4 including scales), end to end, no model:

| | FP8 | MXFP4 | MXFP4 / FP8 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| M=128 | 2.77 TB/s | 1.62 TB/s | 58 % |
| M=192 | 2.32 | 1.49 | 64 % |
| M=256 | 2.15 | 1.38 | 64 % |

MXFP4 moves **53.1 %** of the bytes at **58-64 %** of the rate, which is the
-9 to -18 % that the table shows. To reach -30 % it would have to run at
`0.531 / 0.70` = **76 %** of FP8's rate, i.e. a further 19-33 % of effective
weight-stream throughput.

That headroom is not there. Section 9.13's warp-specialised measurement puts the
kernel at **91-99 % of achievable** already, and the binding resource there is
**shared-memory bandwidth, not the dequant ALU**: the SS path moves ~100 KB of
smem per stage (TMA write, decode read, decode write, WGMMA read) for 17 KB of
HBM, 5.75x amplification. So the remaining headroom is single-digit percent,
against the 19-33 % that -30 % needs.

This also explains why 9.19's instruction saving does not show up end to end.
`bench_sm90_decode_consumer.cu` issues the next bulk copy only after the decode
returns -- decode and load **serialised** -- so it over-weights ALU savings and
reports +1.7 %. The kernel overlaps them and is limited by smem bandwidth, where
removing ALU instructions buys almost nothing. The change is still right (fewer
instructions, same numbers, 1 KB), but its end-to-end value is ~1 point and the
mechanism is not the one the microbenchmark prices. **Do not quote
`bench_sm90_decode_consumer.cu` as a ceiling** -- use
`bench_sm90_warp_specialised_decode.cu`, which reproduces the warp
specialisation.

**MiMo's -34 % is an FP8 regression, not an MXFP4 win.** Across M=192..288 MXFP4
is flat (1214 -> 1215 -> 1310 us) while FP8 jumps 1389 -> 1849 us at M=240 and
plateaus: FP8 hits its own tile cliff there. Real as a ratio, but DSv4's FP8 has
no equivalent cliff in range (693 -> 707 -> 750 -> 893, smooth), and that is the
entire difference between the two shapes. Any "MXFP4 is 30 % faster" claim needs
the baseline's own curve quoted next to it.

---

## 10. Reproducing

The weight-load measurement in section 7.2 needs no allocation at all — it is
nvcc-only and runs on any sm_90a device, including the raplab dev boxes:

```bash
nvcc -O3 -arch=sm_90a -o /tmp/wl tests/bench_sm90_weight_load.cu \
     -lcuda -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64/stubs && /tmp/wl
# -DKSTAGES=N varies pipeline depth; nothing changes above four.
```

Note the raplab boxes cannot run the kernel itself: the only local torch is
2.5, which has no `symm_mem.rendezvous`, so the symmetric buffer the MegaMoE
needs cannot be built there. Everything else runs from a computelab allocation. The scripts and every raw log
live outside the repo, on shared scratch:
`/home/scratch.jinyanc_wwfo/github/DeepGEMM-aichen/work/mxfp4_opt_20260917/` —
`env.sh` (the CUDA 13 tree the JIT needs), `run.sh` (srun wrapper), `sweep.sh`,
`abba.sh` (cross-branch alternation), `switch.sh` (toggle shipped/optimized) and
`results/`. The raplab dev boxes have no SLURM; reach computelab with
`ssh -J us-proxy computelab-sc-01 'bash -s' < script.sh`.
